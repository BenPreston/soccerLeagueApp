In this folder you will find the following:

FOLDERS

There is a favicons folder which contains all of the relevant favicons for the mobile phone app download
There is an images folder this contains all of the images....however you will also find these images in the main folder as currently they haven't been linked properly


HTML DOCUMENTS

There is one html document in the folder. This is the full app although in it each page is shown separately through a hide and view approach

CSS DOCUMENTS

The CSS document is the style for the whole app. Bootstrap is also used by a link in the HTML

JS FILES 

There are four JS files
1) The random_json_generator_code was used to create randomised data online this is not relevant to the app and is not needed other than to create new randomised data. 
2) The nysl_data_made_by_ben is the data that was created and is called in the app
3) The array_calculator uses this data to randomly assign people. For example there are 400 children all with a random position and team. This js assings them into full squads of 16 players of two keepers, six defenders, six midfielders and four attackers. It then randomly assigns one of each position to a game and picks scorers relevant to this game. Again in actually using the app for real data this would be useless
4) The main.js is all of the relevant js that is used in the app and would be used going forward. 

IMAGES 

There are seven images. As stated above really these should be in the images folder but for linking purposes this hasn't been done yet.
